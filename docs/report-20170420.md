## Looking at individual examples

* False positive
    * 41 - `i got food poisoning` -- ignores `did n't get food poisoning` because too long!
    * 7 - `sick new bar`

* False negative
    * 46 - `feeling a tiny bit sick afterwards`
    * 97 - `started to feel nauseous dizzy and my stomach was upset About 20 minutes later I had a terrible urge to throw up My mother and I both threw up`

* Correct
    * 10 - `had horrible food poisoning`
    * 70 - `if I was sick`
