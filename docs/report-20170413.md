## experiments
* regularizations
    - file:///Users/yogi/data/fbnyc/archive/v-regularization.html
    - fixed : logsumexp
    - loss starts to decrease with introduction of regularization
    - accuracy also starts to behave better
    - best result seems to be for 0.001

* quantify logsumexp vs max pooling
    - file:///Users/yogi/data/fbnyc/archive/v-logsumexp_vs_max_pooling.html

* quantify (1-5)-grams on performance
    - file:///Users/yogi/data/fbnyc/archive/v-ngrams.html
    - interestingly very high for unigrams; but weird loss
    - accuracy is increasing
    - fixed at what?
    - best result for 4-grams

* quantify using 5, 10, 20, 50 filters
    - file:///Users/yogi/data/fbnyc/archive/v-numfilters.html
    - best result for 50 filters
