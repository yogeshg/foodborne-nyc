# Baseline Results

Following up on previous work done in [previous paper],
we do the same experiments on Twitter dataset. As before,
we adopt *Biased*, *Silver* and *Gold* data regimes.


Biased
: In this data regime, we only have biased data collected by [keyword classifier]

Silver
: In this data regime, we sample data from the biased complement set, which is huge for Twitter

Gold
: 1000 [verify] sampled for creating the above regime were also sent to [DOHMH] for expert epidemiologists to label

####TODO
The results for this are discussed in Table 1
