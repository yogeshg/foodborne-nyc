main.load_data(datapath, indexpath, embeddingspath, testdata=False)

main.run_experiments(finetune, kernel_sizes, filters, lr, pooling, kernel_l2_regularization, other_params)

main.save_history(history, dirpath)

   Saves the parameters of training as returned by the history object
   of keras Saves the history dataframe, not required since also saved
   by csvloggger Plots the metrics required from this data, this
   depends on the experiment

main.save_model(hyperparams, model, get_filename)

   hyperparams : dict of hyper parameters model : keras model
   get_filename : a function/or lambda that takes in a filename and
   retuns saveable path
